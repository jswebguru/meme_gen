# How to deploy next.js project with the firebase

First, build you project.
> npm run build

Next, configure the dist folder.
Make new folder named "dist" in the project level.
And then, copy the '.next' foldet into the dist folder.
After it, locate the index.js file in the '.next' folder and copy that into the dist folder.
rename pasted '.next' folder into the '_next'

And finally deploy with firebase.
Go to the project directory and start the console.
And init firebase project. # Here, firebase-tools must be installed by 
> firebase init
after the project initialization, replace the index.html file with the built index.html file. # after initialization of the firebase project, automatically index.html file created. you have to replace this file with the project file.
> firebase deploy
With the command line, you can deploy firebase project, "firebase deploy"

Thanks
